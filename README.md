# BakerySimulation
A simulation of a bakery designed to emulate how customers would shop at a bakery and the necessary time constraints.
Customers, shelves, cashiers, bread types, stock, and inventory were all accounted for in the simulated program.
The purpose of the program is to determine the necessary time constraints on a bakery and the allotted time for necessary actions such as how long cashiers should have to ring up a customer as well as how much brea is neccessary. This project was coded using java and was used to show concurrency in java and its effectiveness in real world scenarios.
